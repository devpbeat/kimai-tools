# Kimai Dashboard (Preswald)

This dashboard lets you and your team explore and visualize Kimai timesheet data interactively, with no code required.

---

## How it works
- Loads all CSV files from the `../csv/` folder (generated by your Kimai export CLI)
- Lets you filter by date range and project
- Shows total hours, a table of entries, and charts for hours per day and by activity

---

## How to use

### 1. Export your Kimai data
First, use the CLI tool to export your timesheet data for the months you want to analyze. The CSVs will be saved in the `csv/` folder.

```
python export_kimai_report.py export
```

Repeat for as many months as you want.

### 2. Install Preswald (if you haven't already)
```
pip install preswald
```

### 3. Run the dashboard
From the `dashboard/` folder, run:
```
preswald run kimai_dashboard.py
```

This will open a local web app in your browser where you can:
- Select a date range
- Filter by project
- See total hours, a detailed table, and interactive charts

---

## Notes
- If you add more CSVs to the `csv/` folder, just refresh the dashboard to see the new data.
- If no CSVs are found, you'll see a message prompting you to export some reports first.

## For Product Managers
- No coding required! Just run the above commands and use the dashboard in your browser.
- You can share screenshots or even deploy the dashboard for others to use (see [Preswald docs](https://docs.preswald.com/introduction)).
